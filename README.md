# Equinox

**Equinox** is an open-source Python library designed for large-scale dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, with a focus on routing in air traffic control and weather-aware environments.

Some lessons I learned when creating `equinox` can be found on [my blog](https://intuelle.com).

## Features

- Scalable algorithms for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning
- Specialized tools for air traffic control routing
- Weather-aware decision-making capabilities
- Built to handle traffic learning **at scale**.

## Background

Equinox is the open-source component behind the QUASAR Prediction System, leveraging an adapted Maximum Entropy Inverse Learning framework to learn from extensive historical data based on economic decision theory.
